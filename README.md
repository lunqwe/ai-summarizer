#### Summary

This project aims to provide a web service for text summarization using state-of-the-art natural language processing models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It allows users to input text and receive a concise summary generated by pre-trained models.


#### Setup

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the FastAPI server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   Replace `main` with the filename of your FastAPI application if different.

4. **Access the API:**

   The FastAPI server will start locally. You can access the API endpoints using tools like `curl` or by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API as follows:

- **Endpoint:** `/summarize`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:**
  
  ```json
  {
    "text_input": "Your input text goes here."
  }
  ```

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "summary": "Generated summary of the input text."
  }
  ```
